# Skill Recommender
## Introduction
In this Project I have introduced a approach of problem of job recommendation where in the ﬁrst module considering the career path, some particular skillset are suggested to the user and in second module from given career goal and addition information of the user, algorithm suggest what career path user should choose in order to reach that particular goal. 

The motivation to create job recommender system is to create module for linkdin where there are around 135 million user and to connect the worlds professionals to make them more productive and successful. Nowadays we are daily overwhelmed by huge amounts of information which we are usually unable to process. This fact makes it difﬁcult to identify those information pieces that are really useful, interesting and meaningful to us. Such information pieces may include books, newspapers, web sites, songs, movies, or the CVs of candidates for a job position. A recommender system is based on scientiﬁc domain such as AI, data mining, pattern recognition and machine learning.
